# PyRICE2020
Stochastic simulation model implementation of the RICE2010 model by Nordhaus

## Goal of the model
The PyRICE model can be used to generate emission abatement pathways in the RICE model that are optimzed over multiple objectives. Alternative distributive objectives have been added to the RICE model contrary to the Utilitarian objective in the original RICE 2010 Model.

This model has been connected to the SSP scenarios by aggregating country statistics into the RICE regions. Extra climate uncertainties have been added to analyse expsosure of alternative abatement pathways to deep uncertainty in climate change
